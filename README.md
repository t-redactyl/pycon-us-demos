# PyCon US 2024 demos for data science

There are two demos in this repo:
* `airlines-analysis` which is designed to show off data exploration with tabular data; and
* `llm-prediction` which is designed to demonstrate the Hugging Face integrations.

Within each is a README with instructions on what should be demoed, as well as a requirements file to build the environment.
